     <h2 >A hit song, also known as a hit record, hit single or simply hit, is a recorded song
           or instrumental that becomes broadly popular or well-known. Although hit song means 
           any widely played or big-selling song, the specific term hit record usually refers to
            a single that has appeared in an official music chart through repeated radio airplay 
            audience impressions, or significant streaming data and commercial sales.[1]
