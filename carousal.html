    <h2> 
 Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody,
      rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Music is generally agreed to be a 
      cultural universal that is present in all human societies. Definitions of music vary widely 
      in substance and approach.[5] While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of
       specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are.
        Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity.
         Diverse activities are involved in the creation of music, and are often divided into
          categories of composition, improvisation, and performance.
           Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, 
           including the human voice. It can also be composed, sequenced, or
            otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically,
             such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software 
             on a computer.

     Music often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremony.
      The techniques of making music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. 
      Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals 
      and concerts for various different types of ensembles. Music is used in the production of 
      other media, such as in soundtracks to films, TV shows, operas, and video games.</h2>
