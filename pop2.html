<h2>
The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former
 more accurately describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. 
 Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, 
 the genre is distinguished from chart music.
Impact:

1. Shaping music trends and culture
2. Inspiring new artists and genres
3. Providing escapism and entertainment
4. Reflecting societal values and issues
5. Creating memorable experiences and nostalgia
